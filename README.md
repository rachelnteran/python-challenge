# python-challenge
This challenge folder includes two scripts and two outputs for the PyPoll project and PyBank project.

PyPoll
PyPoll is a project to intake voter information and analyze it to make conclusions on the data.
This script will sort through the data for this election year and count the number of votes for each of the candidates, calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won and determine which candidate won the popular vote 

PyBank
PyBank will intake a series of profit and losses for a given time period and analyze it to make conclusions about the data.
This script will loop through the data to calculate the net total over the time period, count the number of months in the period, and calculate the average monthly change. This data will also find the month with the greatest increase in profit and the greatest decrease in profit
